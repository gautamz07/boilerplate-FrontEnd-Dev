# HTML5 FrontEnd boilerplate

The project serves the purpose of creating a powerful framework for FrontEnd dev's to kickstart a project in HTML5. It includes the basic structure that you would need in any project and comes packaged with a ```package.json``` file that has a few popular jQuery plugins listed already.


## Requirements

You will be required to install node and npm , after which you will have to run the command ```npm install``` in the CMD to install all the plugins listed in package.json . If you want to install a new plugin from npm you will have to run the command ```npm install <PLUGIN NAME> --save-dev```.

P.S. if a plugin is not available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) , you can manually install the plugin by downloading and unziping the plugin and placing it in the ```js/plugins``` folder.


## Additional Notes

* For the favicon you can use [favicon-generator](http://www.favicon-generator.org/) and extract the favion in the ```favicon``` directory.
* For converting custom fonts to web fonts you can use [transfonter](https://transfonter.org/) and extract the fonts in the ```Fonts``` directory.
